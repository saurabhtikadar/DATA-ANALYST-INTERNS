## Task 2: Data Visualization and Storytelling
**Objective :** Create visualizations that convey a compelling story.

**Tools :** Python And Power Bi

**Deliverables :** Visual report

**Dataset names from Kaggle suitable for Task 2 :**
[Superstore.CSV](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final/data)

### Usage
**All steps related to data cleaning and preprocessing are documented in the [superstore.ipynb]() Jupyter Notebook file.**

### Power BI Dashboard:
After cleaning and processing the data, a detailed and interactive dashboard was created using **`Power BI`.**
- The dashboard provides insights into sales trends, profit analysis, and customer behavior.


## Dashboard Insights
The Power BI dashboard showcases the following key insights and metrics:

**1. Total Sales:**
- Displays the overall revenue generated from all transactions.
  
**2. Average Delivery Days:**
- Shows the average time taken to deliver products to customers.

**3. Total Quantity Sold:**
- Summarizes the total number of items sold across all orders.

**4. Sales by Segment:**
- Breaks down sales performance by customer segments (e.g., Consumer, Corporate, Home Office).

**5. Sales by Region:**
- Highlights the revenue contribution from different geographical regions.

**6. Sales by State:**
- Provides a state-wise breakdown of sales to identify high-performing states.

**7. Top 5 Customers:**
- Lists the top 5 customers contributing the most to sales.

**8. Top 5 Most Profitable Products:**
- Highlights the products generating the highest profit margins.

**9. Top 5 Least Profitable (Loss) Products:**
- Identifies the products with the lowest or negative profitability, aiding in decision-making for inventory optimization.

Each of these insights is visualized through simple charts and graphs, providing an intuitive understanding of the dataset's key trends and patterns.

## Final Thoughts
This project demonstrates how data can be `cleaned`, `analyzed`, and `visualized` to uncover valuable insights. Using **`Python`** for preprocessing and **`Power BI`** for dashboards, we turned raw data into meaningful results.

It's a great starting point for learning data `analysis` and `visualization`. Keep exploring and growing! ðŸš€
