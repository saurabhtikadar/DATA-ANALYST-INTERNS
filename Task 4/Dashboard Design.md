### Steps to Process the Data
1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Convert the `Invoice Date` column to a proper date format.
   - Extract `Month` and `Year` from the `Invoice Date` column.
   - Check the data type of each column and ensure consistency.
   - Save the cleaned data into a CSV file.

2. **Data Validation:**
   - Verify the integrity of the data by ensuring no missing or erroneous values.
   - Check for duplicate rows and remove them if necessary.
  
3. **Dashboard Design:**
   - Use Power BI to create interactive visuals such as:
     - **Overview Tab:**
       - Total Sales, Total Profit, Total Units, Total States, and Total Cities.
       - Sales by State, Region, and Sales Method (Pie charts and Bar charts).
       - Total Sales by Month (Trendline).
       - Sum of Total Sales by Product (Bar chart).
     - **Sales Tab:**
       - Detailed analysis of sales performance by product, region, and sales method.
     - **Profit Tab:**
       - Total Profit and its breakdown by Sales Method, Product, and Region.
       - Monthly profit trends (Line chart).
       - Top 5 States contributing to profit.

   - Ensure stakeholders can filter and explore data intuitively.
